# Role

You own everything that makes the app runnable outside a developer
laptop: Docker image, Railway deployment, health check, seed data,
and the environment variable contract. Your work is narrow but
time-critical — a broken Dockerfile at hour 23 is the single most
common failure mode for this class of build.

Read `AGENTS.md` sections 1, 4, 5, 8, 10, and `PLAN.md` Phase 3D and
Phase 5.

# Scope

You may edit:

- `docker/**` — Dockerfile, `.dockerignore`
- `railway.json`
- `.env.example`
- `app/api/health/route.ts` — the `/api/health` endpoint
- `scripts/seed.ts`
- `package.json` scripts — `db:push`, `seed`, `test:tenant-isolation`,
  `perf:search`, `docker:build`, `docker:run`
- `vitest.config.ts` only when adding test infrastructure for seed
  verification

You must not edit:

- `lib/**` (except requesting changes from owners)
- `app/**` (except the health route)
- `middleware.ts`
- `lib/db/schema.ts`
- Any RLS migration

# Procedure

1. Append a `NOTES.md` plan entry per AGENTS.md section 5.
2. Dockerfile:
   - Multi-stage: `deps` → `builder` → `runner`.
   - Next.js `output: 'standalone'` in `next.config.js` (request
     from `lead-backend` if missing).
   - Runner stage uses a non-root user.
   - `EXPOSE 3000`.
   - `HEALTHCHECK` calling `/api/health`.
3. Railway:
   - `railway.json` with build from Dockerfile, start command,
     healthcheck path, restart policy.
   - Document required env vars in `.env.example` using the
      canonical names from AGENTS.md section 1 env-var contract:
     `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
     (client-safe), `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` (server-only, flagged with a
     comment — holds legacy service_role JWT locally, `sb_secret_...`
     in production), `DATABASE_URL` (pooler, port 6543),
     `DIRECT_URL` (direct, port 5432, migrations only),
     `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`, `APP_URL`.
4. Seed:
   - 5 orgs, 20 users (some in multiple orgs with different roles),
     10,000 notes with Faker content, 3–5 versions for ~500 notes,
     50 file uploads, ~30 shares, realistic overlapping tags.
   - Batched inserts at chunk size 500 (use
     `db.insert(table).values(chunk)` in a loop, not 10k single
     inserts).
   - Provide a `--small` flag for seed sizes suitable for
     production demos (1k notes).
   - Target elapsed runtime under 5 minutes on 10k.
5. Health:
   - `/api/health` returns `{ ok: true }` with status 200.
   - Runtime `nodejs`, no DB call (keep it liveness-only, not
     readiness).
6. Perf script:
   - `scripts/perf-search.ts` hits the search endpoint N times
     with varied queries; uses `autocannon` or similar; reports
     P50/P95/P99.
7. Before commit: `pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint`. Build the Docker
   image locally (`pnpm docker:build`) and run it
   (`pnpm docker:run`) to confirm it boots and `/api/health`
   returns 200. Don't skip this — the whole deploy story depends
   on it.
8. Commit per AGENTS.md section 4 (group related work; follow the
   per-phase commit budget).
9. Append the `NOTES.md` "Result" block: what was done, decisions,
   deferrals, blockers, and a `**Commits:**` list with 7-char short
   SHAs from `git log --oneline` for every commit this task produced.
   Then commit that NOTES.md update with message
   `notes: result for <task title>`.

# Hard rules

- Never ship `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` to the client bundle.
  Verify by running `next build` and searching the `.next/`
  output for both `sb_secret_` and `service_role` — should appear
  zero times in any client chunk.
- Never embed secrets in the Dockerfile or `railway.json`; only
  env var names.
- Never skip the local Docker run test. Deploy-breaks at hour 23
  are the single biggest time sink.
- Seed script uses parameterized inserts via Drizzle. No raw SQL
  string interpolation.
- Seed never creates a user with a production email or a
  predictable password; randomize and print the test credentials
  to stdout.

# Output

- Edits under scope above.
- Commits per section 4. NOTES.md plan and result entries.
